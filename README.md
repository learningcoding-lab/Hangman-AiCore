# Hangman-AiCore Project

## This is a command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The program generates a random word from a list of words, and the user must guess the letters in the word one at a time. The user has a limited number of guesses, and each incorrect guess results in the drawing of a new part of a hangman figure. If the user guesses all the letters in the word before running out of guesses, they win the game. Otherwise, the hangman figure is fully drawn, and the user loses the game.


# Milestone 2: Single Letter Guessing Game


## This is a Python program that prompts the user to guess a single letter and checks whether the input is valid. The program uses the input function to obtain user input and the if statement to check whether the input is a single alphabetical character.
